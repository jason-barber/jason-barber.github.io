      <p class="lead">In an effort to understand our individual role within the group collaboration assessments that will follow in the coming weeks and throughout the remainder of the course, we've been instructed to seek three online personality tests and submit our results in this assessment, all of which can be found within the stacked accordion below.</p>
      <p class="lead">The first of these is the Myers-Briggs test and it's reminding me of the fact I'm not  exactly the 'type' of person who's <i>itching</i> to dive into a group nor worry too much about the opinions of others which is something I already knew, though I also know that - as an outsider - my contributions come from a "step-back" or overhead view of the group as a whole and this perspective leaves me very well placed to perceive group dynamics since I am slightly removed instead of submerged in most groups..</p>

        <p>An individual mindset with a free-floating, socially disconnected way of operating makes the ISTP-A much less dependant or affected by the opinions of other people which in turn means more personal freedom to pursue their own goals, interests and ideas without any infuence from society in general.</p>
        <p>Dominant personal attributes are labelled as <em><u>Introverted</u></em>, <em><u>Observant</u></em>, <em><u>Thinking</u></em> and <em><u>Prospecting</u></em> making them naturally curious and mentally agile with a flexibility in their approach that allows the ISTP-A personality to freely adapt to almost any situation they find themselves confronted with.</p><p>I've additionally included the precise percentages of my own test results below, which are..</p>

<p>Strengths of the ISTP-A are their extremely high level of mental energy, creativity and practicality, spontaeneous adaptation to problems, pragmatic/practical thinking, their ability to prioritize and the fact they're great in high-stress or crisis situations because they're too detached and uncaring to panic about ahh, <i>anything</i>.</p>
<p>Weaknesses include that we are stubborn, insensitive to other peoples needs, reserved and detached, <i>super</i> </i>easily bored, dislike investing in long-term effort and are compulsive..</p>

      <p>This online quiz presents visitors with 20 questions, then displays the results and though the questions where reasonably comprehensive in subjects and topics, I found personally the three multible choice answers very limited and often found there was no option for what I would actually do in the situation the question surmised. Nonetheless I took the quiz and the results where pretty simple.</p>

        <p>As I've just mentioned the quiz in question was extremely crippled by the limited options for each question and I don't really have a lot of faith in such a blunt means of testing a persons style of learning, but here is their graph..        </p>

		  <p>Beyond this woefully inaccurate summary of learning style there's a page filled with text that goes into great detail about three different methods of learning and I really don't see there's any point in either copy/pasting or regurgitating what that entails here: merely being hosted on a site purporting to be educational doesn't in any way mean the test is is worth much and I'm quite happy to qualify this with the only common-sense logical argument needed to illustrate why this method of determining an individuals most efficient mode of learning is pointless - driven more by the power of suggestion than any kind of evaluation.</p>
		  <p>In a nutshell, people taking this quiz are narrowed into only a small number of options that don't even come close to representing the full range of human behaviour and I ended up simply chosing one of three options I'd never chose in reality - just to get on with the quiz - so many times, that before the quiz was half way through I'd already realized it was forcing me to fit with the texting when the test should've fit itself to me, human beings generally.</p>

        <p>This test was more interesting though again I'd take it with a grain of salt when we have no idea the logic that sits within the code on the backend so we have no way of knowing how these results are determined, though - at the very least - the test is based on the DSM-5 which is the holy bible of psychology, with the questions put forth being more realistic examples of human feelings and behaviour.</p>

        <p>Of the three highest figures in the above results, Narcissistic PD rates highest so we'll start with their definition of that since - being considered a disorder - that would be the one most likely to cause issues within a group, followed by discriptions of the other two most dominant traits.</p>
        <h3>Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h3>
        <p> Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing   pattern of grandiosity (either in fantasy or actual behavior), an   overwhelming need for admiration, and usually a complete lack of empathy   toward others. People with this disorder often believe they are of   primary importance in everybody&rsquo;s life — and to anyone they meet. While   this pattern of behavior may be appropriate for a king in 16th century   England, it is generally considered inappropriate for most ordinary   people today. </p>
        <p> People with narcissistic personality disorder often display snobbish,   disdainful, or patronizing attitudes. For example, an individual with   this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter&rsquo;s &ldquo;rudeness&rdquo; or   &ldquo;stupidity,&rdquo; or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending   evaluation of the physician. </p>
        <p> In layperson terms, someone with this disorder may be described simply as a &ldquo;narcissist&rdquo; or as someone with &ldquo;narcissism.&rdquo; </p>
        <h3>Antisocial Personality Disorder</h3>
        <p> Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder that is characterized by a   long-standing pattern of disregard for other people&rsquo;s rights, often   crossing the line and violating those rights. A person with antisocial   personality disorder (ASPD) often feels little or no empathy toward   other people, and doesn&rsquo;t see the problem in bending or breaking the law   for their own needs or wants. The disorder usually begins in childhood   or as a teen and continues into a person&rsquo;s adult life. </p>
        <p> Antisocial personality disorder is often referred to as psychopathy or   sociopathy in popular culture. However, neither psychopathy nor   sociopathy are recognized professional labels used for diagnosis. </p>
        <h3>Schizoid Personality Disorder</h3>
        <p> Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing   pattern of detachment from social relationships. A person with schizoid   personality disorder often has difficulty expressing emotions and does   so typically in very restricted range, especially when communicating   with others. </p>
        <p> A person with this disorder may appear to lack a desire for intimacy,   and will avoid close relationships with others. They may often prefer to   spend time with themselves rather than socialize or be in a group of   people. In laypeople terms, a person with schizoid personality disorder   might be thought of as the typical &ldquo;loner.&rdquo; </p>
        <p> Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may have particular   difficulty expressing anger, even in response to direct provocation,   which contributes to the impression that they lack emotion. </p>
        <p>Naturally none of these are positive traits but it's worth including to bookend and balance the more positive traits of the Myre-Briggs test and to know what negative aspects there are so they can be avoided or dealt with.</p>
